Project Summary
This program is designed to calculate the shortest route from point A
to point B. It does so by using the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm. This program also uses 
a binary search tree to hold a list of restaurants for each of the destinations. It also uses an algorithm
for calculating the shortest path through all the vertices.The program consists of a 
Graph.cpp, a Graph.hpp, and a main.cpp

How to Run
This program is very simple to use. It start with a menu with 4 option:

1. shortest path
2. restaurants 
3. adjacent
4. quit

Choosing option 1 prompts user to select starting location and then destination.
The number of miles in the fastest route is displayed on the screen.

Choosing option 2 prompts the user to select a location. From this a method will be called to traverse and print
the binary search tree in alphabetical order. The screen will show a list containing the name, rating, and cost of the 
restaurants in that particular location.

Choosing option 3 prompts user to select two locations and displays on the screen whether 
they are adjacent or not
