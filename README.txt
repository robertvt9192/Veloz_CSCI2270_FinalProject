FINAL PROJECT
For my final project I have decided to make a travelling program. 
My program will make a weighted undirected graph.
The vertices will be cities and it will give the user options on where to travel.
The user will have the option of picking starting and ending locations and then will have the option of deciding whether they'd want to take the shortest, fastest, or cheapest route.
The program will use Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for this.
The user will also have the option of visiting every city in the graph. 
In this case Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm will be used to determine the shortest route to visit all cities.
The user will be able to select a subset of cities as well to travel to.
Each of the cities will also contain a binary search tree of restaurants from that city.
Each of the restaurants will consist of a name, a rating, a type, and a price point.
